# IO Power
Power Libraries is a small project to collect some repeatedly needed or otherwise useful Java 8 classes in a collection of tiny libraries.

For more information check out the [project site](http://power-libraries.github.io/).

IO Power is the first and really tiny library of the Power Libraries. It contains some simple helper method for opening Input- and Outputstreams. The main purpose of IO Power is to make opening streams, readers and writers less cluttered and simple to understand.
