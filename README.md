# IO Power
Power Libraries is a small project to collect some repeatedly needed or otherwise useful Java 9 classes in a collection of lightweight libraries.

For more information check out the [project site](http://power-libraries.github.io/).

IO Power is the first library of Power Libraries. It contains some helper methods for opening Input- and OutputStreams and Readers and Writers. The main purpose of IO Power is to make opening streams, readers and writers less cluttered and simple to understand.
